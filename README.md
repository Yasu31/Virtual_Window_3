# Virtual_Window_3

## OSC

Add OSC
Added OSC integration per UnityOSC

## scene

place Yayoi mirror in scene
much more to do...

added plane (default size is 10x10) that emulates screen

## face position

gets raw values of face's X, Y & scale
computes real life coordinates of users face
as of now, the camera moves with the user. no projection tinkering yet.
